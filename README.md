# Ai Driven Blind Navigation System 

Welcome to the AI-Driven Blind Navigation System project! üåê This innovative initiative aims to empower individuals with visual impairments by harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence for enhanced navigation and interaction with the surrounding environment. Our system integrates cutting-edge technologies, including object detection, canny edge detection, and precise distance measurement, to provide real-time insights into the user's surroundings.

The project offers a versatile experience through four distinct modes:

-[Navigation Mode](https://github.com/ChildEater69): Seamlessly navigate through your environment with the help of advanced object detection and distance measurement algorithms. Experience a new level of independence as the system guides you safely through obstacles.

-[Currency Detection](https://github.com/ChildEater69): Empowering users with the ability to identify and differentiate currency notes effortlessly. This mode enhances financial independence by providing instant currency recognition through the power of AI.

-[Text-to-Speech](https://github.com/ChildEater69): Transforming written information into spoken words, our Text-to-Speech mode ensures that users have access to a wealth of information from printed text, fostering increased autonomy and accessibility.

-[Virtual Assistance](https://github.com/ChildEater69): Offering a user-friendly interface for virtual assistance, this mode provides a range of services and information to enhance the overall user experience.
